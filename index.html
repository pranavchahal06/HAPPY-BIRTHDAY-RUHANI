      <h1> If you're reading this, it means one of two things: either you're about to remove this bookmark, or it's your birthday(and u js remembered abt this)—in which case, happy birthday, sugar cube! I hope every wish of yours comes true.</h1>
      <p> 
        I wanted to share some things I never managed to say in person, because we never got the chance to meet the way I wished we would. It hurts, but I understand your situation. I miss you, and no matter what, you'll always be one of the women I respect the most.

I had hoped for that meeting—a moment when I could hold you close one last time, kiss your forehead, and let you know that I’ll always be there for you. And if the world ever becomes too harsh (though I pray that day never comes), remember that I'll always stand by your side.
